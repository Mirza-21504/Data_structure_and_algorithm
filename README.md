# 📝 Placement Training Daily Log (Python Focus)

This repository is a daily tracker of my placement preparation journey. I am documenting everything I learn and practice each day — from solving coding questions to theory notes and word documents.  
The focus is primarily on **Python-based problem-solving**, covering DSA, algorithms, and system design topics.
